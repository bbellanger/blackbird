["GABA Immunoreactivity in Auditory and Song Control Brain Areasof Zebra FinchesRaphael Pinaud1,2,* and Claudio V. Mello11 Laboratory of Auditory and Vocal Learning, Neurological Sciences Institute, Oregon Health andSciences University, Portland, OR, USAAbstractInhibitory transmission is critical to sensory and motor processing and is believed to play a role inexperience-dependent plasticity. The main inhibitory neurotransmitter in vertebrates, GABA, hasbeen implicated in both sensory and motor aspects of vocalization in songbirds. To understand therole of GABAergic mechanisms in vocal communication, GABAergic elements must becharacterized fully. Hence, we investigated GABA immunohistochemistry in the zebra finch brain,emphasizing auditory areas and song control nuclei. Several nuclei of the ascending auditory pathwayshowed a moderate to high density of GABAergic neurons including the cochlear nuclei, nucleuslaminaris, superior olivary nucleus, mesencephalic nucleus lateralis pars dorsalis, and nucleusovoidalis. Telencephalic auditory areas, including field L subfields L1, L2a and L3, as well as thecaudomedial nidopallium (NCM) and mesopallium (CMM), contained GABAergic cells atparticularly high densities. Considerable GABA labeling was also seen in the shelf area ofcaudodorsal nidopallium, and the cup area in the arcopallium, as well as in area X, the lateralmagnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium, the robust nucleus of the arcopallium andnidopallial nucleus HVC. GABAergic cells were typically small, most likely local inhibitoryinterneurons, although large GABA-positive cells that were sparsely distributed were also identified.GABA-positive neurites and puncta were identified in most nuclei of the ascending auditory pathwayand in song control nuclei. Our data are in accordance with a prominent role of GABAergicmechanisms in regulating the neural circuits involved in song perceptual processing, motorproduction, and vocal learning in songbirds.KeywordsGAD; Avian; NCM; Songbird; Plasticity; HVCINTRODUCTIONGamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebratebrain. GABA-mediated transmission has been implicated in the regulatory control of cellularproperties such as neuronal excitability and the statistical likelihood of neuronal firing and ofpresynaptic neurotransmitter release (Chagnac-Amitai and Connors, 1989a; Chagnac-Amitai*Address Correspondence: Raphael Pinaud, PhD, Department of Neurobiology, Duke University Medical Center, Bryan ResearchBuilding, room 445A, Durham, NC 27710, Tel: (919) 681-1681, Fax: (919) 681-0877, pinaud@neuro.duke.edu.2Current affiliation: Department of Neurobiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USAPublisher's Disclaimer: This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

Thus, GABAergic transmission impacts the generation of appropriateneural codes required for CNS representations of sensory information about the environment,sensorimotor integration, and motor control programs (Bland and Oddie, 2001; Ramanathanet al., 2002; Werhahn et al., 2002; Ziemann et al., 2001). In most brain areas, GABAergic cellsparticipate in local processing microcircuits, although long-range GABAergic projections havealso been described in some systems (Bartlett et al., 2000; Ebner and Armstrong-James,1990; Jones, 1993; Luo and Perkel, 1999a; Luo and Perkel, 1999b; Peruzzi et al., 1997; Sarterand Bruno, 2002).We have been investigating the contribution of GABAergic transmission to the centralrepresentation of vocal communication signals in songbirds. Songbirds are one of the fewanimals groups that evolved the ability to learn vocalizations based on an auditory model(Marler et al., 1972; Marler and Waser, 1977). During the sensory acquisition phase of thesong learning process, the juvenile hears and memorizes the adult song. During thesensorimotor phase, the bird changes its own vocalizations to match the acquired song template.Intact hearing is crucial for both phases: birds raised in acoustic isolation or deafened fail todevelop normal song structure (Konishi, 1965a; Konishi, 1965b; for recent reviews see Zeiglerand Marler, 2004), although some exceptions have been noted (Kroodsma et al., 1997; Leitneret al., 2002). Research in zebra finches and canaries have led to major insights into the neuronalbasis of vocal learning, in large part because telencephalic areas involved in song auditoryprocessing, production and learning have been identified and their connections mapped indetail (Bottjer et al., 1984; Kelley and Nottebohm, 1979; Mello et al., 1998; Nottebohm andArnold, 1976; Nottebohm and Arnold, 1979; Nottebohm et al., 1982; Nottebohm et al.,1976; Scharff and Nottebohm, 1991; Vates et al., 1996). As occurs in other avian species andvertebrate groups, the ascending auditory pathway of songbirds is thought to consist of a seriesof pontine, mesencephalic and thalamic nuclei that convey auditory information from thecochlea to telencephalic centers, although the detailed connectivity of this pathway up to themidbrain has not yet been determined in songbirds (Fig. 1A and B). At the level of thetelencephalon, several auditory areas are located within a prominent caudomedial bulge, orlobule (Mello et al., 1998; Vates et al., 1996). These areas include the primary auditory thalamo-recipient zone field L as well as major field L targets, namely the caudomedial nidopallium(NCM) and the caudomedial and caudolateral mesopallium (CMM and CLM, respectively; weuse here the revised avian brain nomenclature, as detailed in Reiner et al., 2004). From fieldL and these primary targets, auditory input reaches other telencephalic areas (Fig. 1B).Although the specific role of individual constituent nuclei or areas has not been clearlyestablished, these central auditory pathways are thought to be crucial for song auditoryprocessing, perception, and possibly the song memorization required for perceptualdiscrimination and vocal learning (for review, see Mello et al., 2004).Songbirds also possess a set of interconnected forebrain nuclei known as the song controlsystem that can be subdivided into two main pathways (Fig. 1C). The direct motor pathway isessential for the production of learned vocalizations and includes nidopallial nucleus HVC, therobust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), and the descending projections of the latter onto thedorsomedial nucleus of the intercollicular complex (DM), the tracheosyringeal component ofthe hypoglossal nerve (nXIIts), which innervates muscles from the vocal organ (syrinx), andmedullary respiratory control centers. The anterior forebrain pathway is essential for songlearning and consists of area X of the medial striatum, the medial part of the dorsolateral nucleusof the thalamus (DLM), and the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopalliumPinaud and MelloPage 2J Chem Neuroanat. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscript', '(LMAN), which are connected in a circuit organization analogous to mammalian cortico-basalganglia-thalamo-cortical loops (Bottjer et al., 1989;Nottebohm et al., 1982;Nottebohm et al.,1976; for recent reviews, see Zeigler and Marler, 2004).GABAergic transmission has been implicated in the physiology of areas involved in bothauditory and motor processing of vocalizations in songbirds. For example, GABA antagonismaffects synchronized firing within song control nucleus RA and spike properties of projectionneurons in nucleus LMAN (Bottjer et al., 1998; Spiro et al., 1999). We have recently usedmolecular and electrophysiological methods to show that GABAergic cells and synapses areprevalent in telencephalic auditory areas, and that GABAergic neurons show inducedexpression of the activity-dependent gene zenk in response to song auditory stimulation (Pinaudet al., 2004). Thus, inhibitory mechanisms involving GABA appear to participate in theauditory processing, production, and potentially learning of birdsong.In the present work, we have used an anti-GABA antibody for a detailed characterization ofGABAergic elements in auditory and song control areas of the zebra finch brain, to gain furtherunderstanding of the neurochemical organization of circuits involved in vocal communicationand learning in songbirds. We demonstrate that GABAergic cells and processes are prevalentat several levels of the auditory pathway as well as within song control nuclei. Our observationsare consistent with a prominent role of inhibitory mechanisms in the physiology of brain areasthat participate in song auditory processing, learning and production in songbirds.MATERIAL AND METHODSAnimalsWe used a total of 22 adult zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata - 8 females; 14 males) purchasedfrom a breeder and maintained in our local aviary. Experimental protocols utilized in this studywere approved by OHSU’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Comittee (IACUC) and are inaccordance with NIH guidelines. A subset of birds (6 females and 10 males) was maintainedovernight in a sound-proof box. The next day, birds were stimulated with a playback of amedley of conspecific songs for 30 minutes, followed by 1 hr of silence and sacrifice (as inMello and Ribeiro, 1998), in order to test for a possible effect of auditory stimulation on thedistribution of GABAergic neurons. All other birds were directly removed from our aviary andimmediately sacrificed. Based on a preliminary assessment, we did not observe any evidencethat the density of GABAergic neurons was affected by auditory stimulation. Therefore, wecombined the control and stimulated groups for the present report.All birds received an overdose of Nembutal and were quickly perfused transcardially with 10ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) followed by 60 ml of a solution containing 1%paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS. A fast and efficient perfusion withsaline prior to the fixative was critical for preventing GABA signal from being washed off thetissue. Brains were then dissected out of the skulls, cryoprotected by equilibration in a 30%sucrose solution., included in embedding medium (Tissue-Tek; Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA),frozen in a dry-ice/propanol bath, cut on a cryostat (20 μm thick sections), mounted on glassslides (Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and stored at −80°C.Most brains were sectioned on the parasagittal plane, although a few brains (n=3) were cut onthe frontal plane for comparision.Immunohistochemistry (IHC)We used a commercial rabbit anti-GABA polyclonal antibody (Chemicon International,Temecula, CA; catalog # AB141, immunogen KLH-GABA). Slides were removed from the−80°C freezer and allowed to dry at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. Slides were thenPinaud and MelloPage 3J Chem Neuroanat. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscript', 'immersed in PB and hydrated for 30 min, followed by incubation for 2 hr at RT in a blockingbuffer (BB) that consisted of 0.5% albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1M phosphate buffer(PB; pH 7.4). Sections were then washed for 30 min (3 × 10 min washes) in PB and incubatedovernight at 4°C with the anti-GABA antibody (1:200 dil in BB), in a humid chamber. Theslides were then washed for 30 min (3 × 10 min) in PB and incubated for 2 hr at RT with abiotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:200 dil in BB; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).Sections were then washed for 30 min in PB and incubated for 2 hr at RT in avidin-biotincomplex (1:100 dil in PB; ABC Elite kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The slideswere then washed for 30 min (3 × 10 min) in PB and incubated in a filtered solution containing0.03% diaminobenzidine, 0.15% Nickel sulfate and 0.001% hydrogen peroxide in PB. Sectionswere periodically monitored for signal under a microscope and reaction was stopped byimmersion in PB. The sections were then dehydrated in a standard series of alcohols,delipidized in xylene, and coverslipped.Specificity ControlsOmission of the primary antibody resulted in absence of cellular staining, demonstrating thespecificity of our IHC detection system (secondary antibody plus ABC reagent). As discussedpreviously (Grisham and Arnold, 1994), preabsorption of the primary anti-GABA antibodywith GABA alone does not block the immunoreactive product detected with this antibody.Rather, to establish the specificity of this antibody, it is necessary to pre-absorb it with GABAconjugated to a carrier protein, analogous to the immunizing molecule used to generate thisantibody. We therefore generated a GABA-BSA conjugate as described previously (Walrondet al., 1993), with modifications. We first cross-linked GABA (5 mM) with BSA (5 mg/ml)using glutaraldehyde (at 1% in 0.1 M PB) for 1 hr at RT, under stirring. This solution was thendialyzed against 30 volumes of cold 0.01 M PB (10 volumes/day for 3 days, at 4°C). To pre-absorb the anti-GABA antibody with the conjugate, we incubated the antibody at its workingdilution with various concentrations of the post-dialysis conjugate overnight at 4°C underagitation. The pre-absorbed antibody was then used in the IHC procedure. We found that pre-absorption with both 10 μM and 50 μM (but not 1 μM) of the GABA-BSA conjugatesuccessfully and completely abolished GABA-like immunoreactivity in brain sections (Fig.2B). Further pre-absorption controls using unbound BSA at the same concentrations as for theGABA-BSA conjugate did not alter GABA-like immunoreactivity in our preparations (Fig.2A). These pre-absorption procedures are in accordance with the J. Comp. Neurol.recommendations for determining antibody specificity (Saper and Sawchenko, 2003).Imaging and AnalysisWe used a Nikon E-600 microscope equipped with a motorized stage drive (LEP Mac5000),and coupled to a PC containing the Neurolucida software (Microbrightfield Inc., Colchester,VT) through the Lucivid system for morphometry, or through a digital camera (DVC, Austin,TX) for photomicrograph acquisition. Acquired photomicrographs were transferred to AdobePhotoshop software, where levels were adjusted and illustration plates assembled.For cell size estimates, we measured the largest linear soma diameter of any given cell usingNeurolucida’s “Measurement” tool. For each area of interest, we randomly sampled a fewhundred neurons in non-overlapping fields throughout the areas investigated, across 3 birds.In Table 1, we represent the absolute values for the largest and smallest soma diametermeasured as “Cell Diameter Range” and the “Average Diameter”. While it is possible thatsome subregions of the soma may not have been stained with the anti-GABA antibody,indicating a possible subcellular compartmentalization of GABA distribution, the stainingpatterns we observed were largely comparable with the cellular staining patterns observedpreviously for the GABAergic cell marker zGAD65, most importantly the clear definition ofsmall and large cell populations (Pinaud et al., 2004). This gives strong indication that thePinaud and MelloPage 4J Chem Neuroanat. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscript', 'patterns we have observed and quantified represent well the morphological properties ofGABAergic cell somata. Caution is also warranted when considering that some smaller celldiameters quantified in our preparations could represent partial profiles of larger cells that werenot fully included in sections analyzed. Even though this possibility would account for minorvariations in the estimates obtained for smaller cells, it may have had an effect on estimatesfor larger cells. However, it is important to consider that the same method was appliedthroughout the brain and that the estimates reveal clear regional differences in both diameteraverage and range, including the upper limit of the latter. In many cases such differences areconsistent with regional variations in cell size that are also clearly seen by Nissl. This supportsthe notion that the size estimates described here closely reflect regional differences in cell size.The quantitative analysis above was performed only in a subset of the birds (n=3 males, brainscut parasagitally) where high quality histological preparations could be obtained for all areasanalyzed. A qualitative assessment of the staining patterns indicated that the overall distributionof stained elements throughout the brain and in auditory areas was similar in females incomparison with males. The song control nuclei, which are markedly dimorphic in this species,could not be reliably identified in our IHC preparations of females. Therefore, no attemptswere made at quantifying possible sex differences in GABAergic cell distribution.RESULTSTo reveal GABAergic cells in the zebra finch brain, we performed IHC with an anti-GABAantibody that has been previously used in this species (Grisham and Arnold, 1994). We couldidentify labeled cells in most brain areas examined. The majority of these cells was small, mostlikely representing inhibitory neurons that participate in local networks, as described in othersystems. Several areas, however, also contained a small contingent of very large labeled cells.Immunolabeled fibers and punctate staining were also observed in the majority of regionsanalyzed. The issue of specificity of the anti-GABA antibody we used was previously discussed(Grisham and Arnold, 1994). We have incorporated, however, critical pre-absorption controls(see Methods and Fig. 2) to further establish the specificity of the staining patterns in ourpreparations. In addition, we examined the labeling in some populations of well-knownGABAergic neurons (Batini et al., 1992; Gabbott et al., 1986; Sastry et al., 1997). In thecerebellum, we observed strongly labeled cells in the deep nuclei (Fig. 3A–C). These cellswere typically large with strongly-labeled triangular soma (Fig 3B and C; arrowheads). ThePurkinje cells were probably the most heavily labeled cells in the brain (Fig. 3D and E). Thesecells were markedly large and relatively uniform in size across cerebellar folia. We observedstrong immunoreactivity in the soma of virtually all Purkinje cells, and in most cases were ableto discern negative cell nuclei (Fig. 3D, arrowheads). We also observed strong labeling overlarge extensions of the dendritic arborizations of Purkinje cells. These processes could oftenbe followed for a few hundred microns into the molecular layer, where they branched profusely,forming a dense immunoreactive network (Fig. 3D and E). The molecular layer also containedseveral smaller GABA-positive cells that, based on the location, size and number, likelycorrespond to basket neurons (Fig. 3D and E, arrows).Labeled cells were also observed in the globus pallidus (GP). As is characteristic of this area(Churchill and Kalivas, 1994; Smith and Bolam, 1990; Smith et al., 1987), these neurons werevery large and relatively sparse, with a predominantly triangular soma and a high density ofimmunostaining (Fig. 3F and G). Many labeled cells lined up close to the border with thestriatum (St), into which they extended prominent immunolabeled dendritic processes that werealigned with the dorso-ventral axis. Such processes were particularly visible in the caudal GPand caudal St (CSt; Fig. 3G, arrows). The dorsal border of the GP could be distinguished dueto the very low density of labeled cells in the CSt (Fig. 3F). The GP also contained a highdensity of uniformly distributed punctate staining.Pinaud and MelloPage 5J Chem Neuroanat. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscript', 'Thus, known populations of GABAergic neurons are readily and reliably identified in ourpreparations, and their morphology and distribution are in accordance with previous studies.The staining pattern in the GP also provides further supportive neurochemical evidence for thecorrespondence between this structure in the avian and mammalian brains, according to therecently revised avian brain nomenclature (Reiner et al, 2004). Below we describe the stainingpatterns we observed in the nuclei of the ascending auditory pathway, followed by auditoryand vocal control areas of the telencephalon. The nuclei in the ascending auditory pathwaywere identified based on the published pigeon (Karten, 1967) and canary brain atlases (Stokeset al., 1974); the lemniscal nuclei were not examined as they could not be reliably identifiedin our preparations. All density estimates of GABA-positive cells are relative to the neuronalcounts per area based on Nissl-stained adjacent sections. We have processed both hemispheresof all birds included in this study. Although we did not attempt a quantitative assessment, wehave observed a similar overall pattern of staining in both hemispheres. All quantificationspresented were performed on the left hemispheres.Ascending Auditory PathwayNucleus magnocellularis (NM)—We observed a high density of labeled cells in thisnucleus (Fig. 4C and D). These cells were evenly distributed and had predominantly round orovoid labeled somata with no evident stained neurites. The cells were relatively large (18.2μm average diameter, 12.2 to 26.4 μm range; Fig. 4D and Table 1), and the majority of themdisplayed strong immunolabeling, suggesting the presence of high GABA contents (Fig. 4D).A moderate density of punctate staining could be observed, uniformly distributed throughoutthe extent of NM. It is worth noting that a low level of background staining persisted in thisnucleus in the pre-absorption control. This is most likely due to an “edge-of-section” effect,as magnocellularis is located close to the (ventricular) border of the tissue. At any rate, themarked decrease in immunolabeling observed with the pre-absorption argues for the specificityof the staining in NM.Nucleus angularis (NA)—Qualitatively, nucleus angularis had a very low density of labeledcells compared to all other areas in the present study. These cells had an asymmetricdistribution, the lowest density occurring laterally and the highest density medially (Fig. 4B),and were moderately small (11.1 μm average diameter, 5.6 to 15.8 μm range; Table 1). Thesoma morphology varied from round and oval to elongated (Fig. 4F). In addition,immunostaining was mostly confined to the soma but in some cases stained proximal neuritescould be seen (Fig. 4F; arrowhead). Strong punctate staining could also be observed in NA,apparently over the somata of unlabeled cells (Fig. 4F).Nucleus laminaris (NL)—Slightly lateral to NM, nucleus laminaris (NL) displayed amoderate density of labeled cells. These cells had an asymmetric distribution, a higher densityof immunolabeling perykaria seen laterally and a lower density ventromedially (Fig. 4C). Themajority of labeled neurons had ellipsoid and moderately to strongly labeled somata (Fig. 4E,arrows), with no apparent labeled neurites. These cells were relatively small (9.7 μm averagediameter, 5.7 to 13.7 μm range; Table 1). We also observed several clusters of coarse labeledpuncta over what may represent unlabeled somata (Fig. 4E, arrowheads), suggesting that non-GABAergic cells in this nucleus receive strong GABAergic input.Superior olivary nucleus (SON)—A moderate overall density of labeled cells wasdetected in this nucleus. Their somata were mostly small (7.6 μm average diameter, 3.9 to 12.4μm range; Table 1) and their shape varied from round or ovoid to triangular and pyramidal-like (Fig. 5B and C). The cells had moderate staining, but presented strongly labeled and coarsepuncta over the soma (Fig. 5C). Such puncta were also distributed over the entire extent of theSON. Larger and more strongly labeled cells were more evident ventrally (Fig. 5B).Pinaud and MelloPage 6J Chem Neuroanat. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscript', 'Nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis, pars dorsalis (MLd)—A relatively high densityof GABA-stained cells was observed in this nucleus (Fig. 6B). They had a wide size range (6.7to 28.4 μm in diameter; Table 1) and marked variation in morphology. Both large neurons withvaried soma shapes and small neurons with predominantly round soma were seen (Fig. 6C).Both cell types often exhibited immunopositive neurites that extended from the soma (Fig. 6C;arrowheads) and branched, forming a dense network of labeled processes and punctate stainingwith a reticular aspect throughout MLd. Interestingly, the strongest staining in both cell typeswas nuclear, with a more modest labeling seen in the soma (Fig. 6C; arrows). Although a smallnumber of cells with nuclear staining was occasionally seen in other brain areas, the occurrenceof such cells was most prominent in MLd. This staining pattern was abolished in our antibodypre-absorption controls, arguing for the specificity of this staining pattern.Nucleus ovoidalis (Ov)—GABA-positive neurons were present both in the core and shellregions of Ov (Fig. 7B). Most of these cells had predominantly round or ellipsoid soma thatwere strongly labeled (Fig. 7C), and had the smallest soma size compared to all other auditoryareas examined (6.7 μm average; Table 1). GABA-positive neurites were rarely seen, exceptfor occasional moderately-stained processes in non-spherical neurons (Fig. 7C, arrowheads).A moderate density of punctate staining was seen throughout the extent of Ov.Auditory Areas in the TelencephalonField L (L1, L2a and L3)—Field L is a large structure, occupying an extensive area of thecaudal telencephalon and consisting of several subdivisions. Most of our analysis, includingmorphometry, was carried out in parasagittal sections approximately 0.9 to 1.0 mm lateral tothe midline, where the major field L subdivisions L1, L2a and L3 could be clearly identifiedbased on cytoarchitectonic criteria in Nissl-stained sections adjacent to those reacted for GABAIHC. In addition, the boundaries of L2a could also be defined in GABA immunostainedmaterial itself, as labeled cells in this area were organized in a distinct string-like fashion alongthe dorso-ventral axis. For lack of reliable boundaries in our sections, we did not examinesubfield L2b. The caudal boundary of L1 and the rostral boundary of L3 could be easilyidentified based on the intersection of L2a with the lamina pallialis subpallialis that separatesfield L from the adjacent CSt. However, the anterior boundary of L1 and the posterior boundaryof L3 could not be identified either by Nissl or by IHC.Relatively high densities of labeled cells were detected in L1, L2a and L3. These cells had amostly homogeneous distribution at this level of the brain (Fig. 8A). The labeled cells werepredominantly round and had a wide size range (4 to 22 μm in diameter; Table 1), but tendedto be slightly larger in L2a (13.2 μm average diameter) than in L1 and L3 (9.4 and 10.8 μmaverage diameter, respectively; Table 1). Cells in all subdivisions had moderately high somastaining; however, very few immunostained processes and puncta were seen. The medial-mostpart of subdivision L2a could be clearly seen in medial parasagittal sections that also containedNCM and CMM (Fig. 9C). At this level, the large cells in L2a were very strongly labeled, butnumerous smaller cells could also be seen.Caudomedial Nidopallium (NCM)—This field L target is also a large and complex area.Our analysis focused on medial parasagittal sections (between 0.7 and 1.0 mm lateral to themidline), where the boundaries of NCM are very distinct (the ventricular zone dorsally,caudally and ventrally, and the lamina mesopallialis, or LaM, and field L2a rostrally). GABA-labeled cells were highly prevalent in NCM. Labeled cells in NCM were evenly distributed(Fig. 9B), with relatively few clusters of 2–4 cells observed (Fig. 9E, arrowhead).Immunoreactive neurons tended to be round or ellipsoid, with strongly stained soma andoccasional labeled neurites (Fig. 9E–G). These cells also displayed high variation in diameterand a relatively small average size (Table 1). Qualitatively, they appeared to fall into twoPinaud and MelloPage 7J Chem Neuroanat. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscript', 'predominant types. The first exhibited small soma (3.3–10 μm diameter range) with variedshapes and pronounced processes (Fig. 9F and G; arrowheads). The second had a larger soma(15–20.8 μm diameter range) with round shape and few processes (Fig. 9F and G; arrows).Both types were present throughout NCM, but the smaller cell type was more prevalent. Thelarger type was comparable to that seen in adjacent field L2a (Fig. 9C; arrowheads). Noapparent punctate staining could be observed in NCM.Caudomedial Mesopallium (CMM)—A relatively high density of GABA-labeled cellscould be identified in CMM (Fig. 9D). They were distributed throughout this area, and had atendency to group into clusters of 3–5 cells (Fig. 9D, arrowheads). Such clusters are typical ofCMM, and can be readily identified in sections counterstained for Nissl. GABA-labeled cellsin CMM were mainly round or oval and had a wide size range (~4 μm to 19 μm in diameter).The majority of these cells appeared to be small (7 μm average diameter, 4–12 μm range; Table1), although some larger neurons (15–19 μm diameter range) could also be observed.Immunolabeled cells had relatively high and uniform soma staining, and labeled neurites andpunctate staining were rarely seen.Nidopallial shelf area—The dorsal boundary of this field L target corresponds to the ventralboundary of HVC, but its ventral boundary can only be identified with tract-tracing (Vates etal., 1996). Our current analysis was restricted to a 200 μm thick domain immediately ventralto HVC. A modest density of labeled cells could be identified in this region. These cells weredistributed along the shelf (Fig. 10B), with no apparent clusters, and had round to ellipsoidsomata with strong and homogeneous labeling (Fig. 10D). They tended to be slightly smaller(8.9 μm average diameter; Table 1) compared to the adjacent HVC. Very few neurites wereimmunolabeled and those did not extend far from the soma. Only low levels of punctate stainingwere observed.Arcopallial cup area—The internal boundary of the cup area adjacent to song nucleus RAis defined by RA itself, but the external boundary does not exhibit any distinct cytoarchitectonicfeatures and can only be defined by tract-tracing (Mello et al., 1998). Based on the latter, thecup region extends rostroventrally for about 500 μm from the rostroventral boundary of RA.An apparent high density of GABA-positive cells (assessed within 200 μm from the RAboundary) was observed in this region (Fig. 11E and F). These cells were mostly small (7 μmaverage diameter), had a narrow size range (4.4 to 10.5 μm; Table 1), and tended to segregateinto groups, but not in clusters (Fig. 11F; arrows). The majority displayed a round or ovoidsoma that was heavily stained, with no apparent immunolabeled processes (Fig. 11F). Somecells, though, particularly those with moderate staining, had more varied shapes andimmunopositive proximal neurites. The cup region also contained lightly immunolabeledprocesses that formed a modest mesh, as well as a moderately high density of punctate staining.Telencephalic Song Control NucleiNucleus Interfacialis (NIf)—NIf could be identified in some of our GABA IHCpreparations as a small domain embedded between L1, L2a and CSt (Fig. 8A). Compared tothe adjacent L1 and L2a, labeled cells in nucleus NIf were relatively large (9.4 μm averagediameter; 3.4 to 16.7 μm range; Table 1). They exhibited relatively strong and uniform somastaining, were uniformly distributed, with no apparent clusters, and had a predominantly roundor ovoid soma, although some cells were more elongated (Fig. 8B). Very few processes andlittle punctate staining could be seen in this area.Lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN)—LMANboundaries could easily be identified based on GABA IHC staining due to the markeddifference in labeled cell sizes between LMAN and the surrounding nidopallium (Fig. 12B).Pinaud and MelloPage 8J Chem Neuroanat.

These cells were evenlydistributed, with no apparent cell clusters (Fig. 12B). Although labeled cells in LMAN tendedto be large (12 μm average diameter), several small labeled neurons could also be seen (5 to23.8 μm diameter range; Table 1). The small cells tended to have more round or elongatedsomata compared to the larger cells (Fig. 12C, arrows). The larger cell type displayed highlyvariable shapes that ranged from oval to more complex types (Fig. 12C, black arrowheads).Most labeled cells exhibited strong immunostaining in the soma and moderate staining of theirproximal dendrites (Fig. 12C, white arrowheads). Punctate staining was modest, but moremarked in the vicinity of the larger cells.Area X of the striatum—The boundaries of this song nucleus could be easily defined basedon the different densities of immunolabeled cells between this region and the surroundingstriatum (Figure 13B). A very high density of labeled cells was detected in area X. They wereevenly distributed, although a few occasional clusters were seen, and were predominantly small(average diameter 7 μm; range 3.6 to 22.6 μm; Table 1). A qualitative evaluation indicated thatimmunolabeled cells fell into one of two groups: 1) small cells were more numerous and tendedto have a round or slightly oval soma (Fig. 13C, arrowheads), and sometime an associatedlabeled neurite; and 2) large cells (3 to 5 times larger diameter than the smaller cells) weremuch fewer and had mostly round somata (Figure 13C, arrows).

They displayed strong and homogeneous somatic staining, with veryfew labeled processes evident. No punctate staining was detected in HVC.Robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA)—The borders of RA could be easily identifiedin our preparations because the morphology and size of GABA-labeled cells in RA differedmarkedly from those in the surrounding arcopallium, and because of a low signal zonedemarcating the boundary between RA and the neighboring arcopallium (Fig. 11B, C and E).A high density of labeled cells was observed in RA. These cells tended to be large (14.3 μmaverage diameter) but had a broad size range (6.4–28.5 μm diameter; Table 1) and wereuniformly distributed. Their morphology ranged from cells with round- or oval-shaped somatato pyramidal- and multipolar-like cells (Fig. 11D) and they typically exhibited heavy somaticimmunostaining and a negative nucleus (Fig. 11D). Most cells had pronounced labeledprocesses that extended from the soma and then branched extensively, forming an intricatenetwork throughout RA (Fig. 11D). Despite high neuritic labeling, little punctate staining wasobserved.DISCUSSIONWe provide here a detailed account of the distribution of GABAergic elements in auditoryprocessing areas and song control nuclei in the brain of zebra finches. We found that GABA-positive cells are prevalent in several of the examined nuclei of the ascending auditory pathway,in auditory telencephalic areas, and in nuclei of both the anterior and posterior forebrainpathways within the song control system. In addition, GABAergic processes and puncta,presumably corresponding to GABAergic terminals, were observed in a number of these areas.These observations are consistent with the view that GABA plays a significant role in variousaspects of birdsong representation, such as song perceptual processing and memorization,Pinaud and MelloPage 9J Chem Neuroanat. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscript', 'motor control of song production, and vocal learning. Below we discuss the implications ofthese findings.GABAergic Elements in the Ascending Auditory PathwayThe avian ascending auditory pathway has been most extensively investigated in the barn owl,in the context of sound localization, and in chicks, in relation to general auditory physiology.Studies on nuclei angularis (NA) and magnocellularis (NM), which together comprise the aviancochlear nuclei, and nucleus laminaris (NL), thought to correspond to the mammalian medialsuperior olive (Boord, 1968), have demonstrated a prominent role of GABAergic mechanismsin auditory stimulus processing and encoding. NA encodes the intensity of sound in a seriesof spike trains, while NM is primarily concerned with temporal properties of the stimulus(Fukui and Ohmori, 2004; Monsivais and Rubel, 2001; Sullivan and Konishi, 1984; Takahashiet al., 1984; Warchol and Dallos, 1990; Young and Rubel, 1983). Projections from NMprimarily target NL, where interaural time differences (ITDs) required for sound localizationare computed (Carr and Konishi, 1990; Overholt et al., 1992; Young and Rubel, 1983). Patch-clamp recordings in NL have shown that GABAergic inhibition increases coincidencedetection of excitatory projections (Funabiki et al., 1998). In addition, the strength of GABAtransmission may allow for either an increase or decrease in neuronal excitability in NL(Bruckner and Hyson, 1998). Electrophysiological recordings in the chick, though, indicatethat NM is not the primary source of inhibitory input to NL (Zhou and Parks, 1991). Indeed,a GABAergic projection from NM to NL appears to be absent in this species (Bruckner andHyson, 1998). Robust GABAergic projections in the chick have been described from thesuperior olivary nucleus (SON) to both NL and NM (Lachica et al., 1994; Monsivais et al.,2000; Yang et al., 1999), the latter regulating the fidelity of phase-locking of auditory signals(Monsivais et al., 2000). Feedback inhibition from SON onto NL contributes to the temporalintegration and coincidence detection required for ITD computations (Yang et al., 1999).Feedback networks that affect auditory processing in NL and NM via the GABAergicprojections from SON have been proposed to arise from NA projections to SON, but theneurochemical identity of the latter is not clear (Brainard et al., 1992; Knudsen and Konishi,1978). In sum, GABAergic influence early in the auditory pathway regulates both gain controland the representation of temporal auditory cues in the cochlear nuclei of non-oscines.Our findings in the zebra finch are consistent with a prominent role of GABA-mediatedinhibition at early stages of the ascending auditory pathway of songbirds. The moderately highdensity of GABA-positive puncta and neuropil we observed in NM and NL could correspondto the innervation arising from SON. Indeed, relatively large GABAergic cells exist withinSON that could correspond to inhibitory projection neurons. Thus, some basic aspects ofGABAergic inhibition at the level of cochlear nuclei may be conserved between songbirds andchicks. Our results, however, also provide evidence for the presence of GABAergic cells inboth the NM and NL of zebra finches. This finding contrasts with previous reports of very lownumbers of such cells in the NM and NL of the chick and barn owl (Code et al., 1989; vonBartheld et al., 1989). Further studies with other GABAergic cell markers in both species wouldbe helpful to further investigate this apparent species difference and to determine its potentialimpact on the physiology of these nuclei in songbirds. At any rate, significant speciesdifferences in the organization and development of the ascending auditory pathways have beenpreviously described in birds. Such differences have been suggested to relate to specializationsin auditory processing capabilities and strategies (Kubke and Carr, 2000; Kubke et al., 2004).By analogy, different evolutionary pressures might have contributed to a significantly largerGABAergic influence in the auditory brainstem of songbirds, as compared to other avianspecies. This neurochemical difference could thus be related to aspects of auditory processingthat are of relevance to vocal learning, a behavior not found in the chick and barn owl, the mainexperimental avian models of brainstem auditory physiology.Pinaud and MelloPage 10J Chem Neuroanat. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscript', 'GABAergic elements and GABA-mediated inhibition are also prominent at higher levels ofthe avian ascending auditory pathway. Nucleus MLd in the intercollicular complex (ICo)receives direct projections from SON and from cochlear nuclei, and is considered homologousto the central nucleus of the mammalian inferior colliculus (IC) (Conlee and Parks, 1986).Research in both mammals and birds has shown that GABAergic transmission in the ICcontrols several aspects of auditory information coding, including the representation of soundintensity and location (Knudsen et al., 2000; Pollak et al., 2003; Sivaramakrishnan et al.,2004; Zheng and Knudsen, 1999). Inhibition through the GABA-A receptor has been shownto participate in the sharpening of auditory tuning-curves in the IC and at other sites along theascending auditory pathway in both mammals and birds (Chen and Jen, 2000; Suga et al.,1997; Yang et al., 1992). Numerous GABAergic neurons are also present in the medialgeniculate body (MGN), the main auditory nucleus of the mammalian thalamus, withsignificant species differences occurring in the number of such cells (Winer and Larue,1996). Indeed, it has been suggested that an increase in inhibitory influence in the auditorythalamus across species might correlate with the complex processing required for speech-likecommunication signals (Winer and Larue, 1996).Our data demonstrate that numerous GABAergic cells are present in the MLd of zebra finches,and suggest the existence of distinct GABAergic cell types, including small and more numerouscells that likely correspond to local inhibitory interneurons, as well as much larger cells.Interestingly, recent studies have revealed a significant inhibitory projection from the inferiorcolliculus to the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) in mammals (Bartlett et al., 2000; Peruzziet al., 1997; Winer et al., 1995; Winer et al., 1996). In avian species, the equivalent circuitryconsists in the projection from MLd to thalamic nucleus Ov, the avian homologue of the ventraldivision of the mammalian MGN (Brauth et al., 1987; Karten, 1967). While this projection islikely to be predominantly excitatory, it could also contain an inhibitory component originatingfrom putative GABAergic projection neurons in MLd. Consistent with this possibility is ourobservation that Ov displays a moderate level of GABAergic terminals. Alternatively, suchterminals could arise from local connections, or from descending inhibitory projectionstargeting Ov. Unlike what has been described for the pigeon (Veenman and Reiner, 1994), weobserved a high density of GABAergic neurons in Ov, consistent with the possibility that thedensity of such cells in the auditory thalamus may correlate with the complexity of thalamicauditory processing required for vocal communication (Winer and Larue, 1996). Interestingly,MLd had a high incidence of cells with a nuclear staining pattern. Our specificity controlsindicate that this is not an artifactual pattern, but its functional significance is unclear.Songbirds rely on the auditory processing of complex stimuli for the individual recognitionthat underlies behaviors such as territoriality, mate selection and courtship (Catchpole andSlater, 1995), as well as for song learning and for the maintenance of the stereotyped adultsong (Konishi, 1965a; Leonardo and Konishi, 1999; Nordeen and Nordeen, 1992).Appropriately tuned auditory responses along the auditory pathway likely correlate with theperceptual processing of acoustic features of song. Based on the precedent in mammals (Ehretet al., 2003; Ferragamo et al., 1998; Poirier et al., 2003; Suga et al., 1997; Wenstrup, 1999),we suggest that MLd and Ov in songbirds participate in the shaping of auditory responseproperties that are relevant to birdsong representation, such as frequency tuning. Songbirds,including zebra finches, can discriminate frequencies with reasonable accuracy, as evidencedby their ability to match their own vocalizations to the tutor’s song in the context of vocallearning. More specifically, juveniles gradually shift the fundamental frequency of somesyllables to maximize imitation (Tchernichovski et al., 2001). Such a process likely requiresplastic changes in brain representations of song and could involve the dense GABAergicnetworks at the level of MLd and Ov. Although GABAergic inhibition has not been studiedin the ascending auditory pathway of songbirds, the high prevalence of GABAergic elementsPinaud and MelloPage 11J Chem Neuroanat. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscript', 'in zebra finches is consistent with a key role of inhibition in the physiology of this pathwayand, thus, in the auditory coding of birdsong.GABAergic Elements in Auditory Telencephalic AreasGABAergic cells were highly abundant in auditory areas of the zebra finch telencephalon andappear to consist of distinct populations of inhibitory neurons. While the smaller cells mostlikely participate in local circuits, it is possible that at least some of the large cells mightrepresent inhibitory projection neurons, as has been demonstrated for striatal song nucleus areaX (Luo and Perkel, 1999a; Luo and Perkel, 1999b). Interestingly, the distribution of largeversus small GABAergic cells in the auditory telencephalon was not symmetric. The majorityof GABA-positive neurons in field L subfields L1 and L3 belonged to the smaller type, whereasin the thalamo-recipient field L2a, particularly in its medial portion, the larger GABAergiccells were more prevalent. These findings are in accordance with the mRNA distribution ofthe zebra finch homologue of the 65 kD glutamic-acid decarboxylase (zGAD65), the syntheticenzyme for GABA, in auditory areas of zebra finches (Pinaud et al., 2004). zGAD65-positivecells also segregate into two populations based on soma size and expression levels ofzGAD65. While small cells with relatively low zGAD65 levels are found throughout subfieldsL1 and L3 and the adjacent NCM and CMM, large neurons with high zGAD65 levels are foundmostly in field L2a, where they are the predominant GABAergic cell type (Pinaud et al.,2004). Further studies are required to determine whether any of the large GABAergic cells inthese early auditory telencephalic areas might be projection neurons. We are not aware of anyevidence detailing a qualitative distinction of GABAergic cell types in mammalian systems,therefore, it is possible that this is feature is unique to the avian brain.Higher-order auditory areas of the telencephalon are also involved in the auditory processingof birdsong and may play an important role in the formation of song auditory memories (Mello,2002; Mello et al., 2004). In particular, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) and mesopallium(CMM) display robust responses to birdsong auditory stimulation, as revealed byelectrophysiological recordings and expression analysis of the activity-dependent gene zenk(Chew et al., 1995; Gentner and Margoliash, 2003; Mello and Ribeiro, 1998; Mello et al.,2004; Mello et al., 1992). Until recently, however, very little was known about inhibitoryelements in these areas. Based on in-situ hybridization for zGAD65, we have recently estimatedthat 36–43% of the neuronal cells in caudomedial auditory structures are GABAergic (Pinaudet al., 2004). Based on a qualitative assessment of the immunocytochemical profile describedhere, these densities may be even higher than those observed in our previous report (Pinaud etal., 2004). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that GABAergic cells expressing onlythe 67kD isoform of GAD were not detected with the zGAD65 probe, but clarifying this issueawaits molecular probes specific for GAD67. Nonetheless, double in situ hybridization hasshown that about 42% of the cells that express zenk in response to song stimulation expresszGAD65 and are therefore GABAergic (Pinaud et al., 2004). Altogether, these findings provideclear evidence that GABAergic neurons participate in the auditory response to birdsong andsuggest that they might contribute to the perceptual processing that underlies song memoryformation and vocal-learning.An intriguing finding of the present work is the high density of GABA-positive neurons invarious auditory areas of the songbird telencephalon compared to mammalian auditory areas,where GABAergic cells have been estimated to represent 25–30% of the overall neuronalpopulation, being primarily concentrated in cortical layers 2–4 (Gabbott and Somogyi, 1986;Jones, 1993). It has been proposed that the avian brain, even though lacking for the most parta cortical laminar organization, contains neuronal populations that are comparable to those invarious layers of the mammalian cortex (Karten, 1991; Mello et al., 1998; Reiner et al.,2004). Although great caution should be exercized in such a comparison, the various areas thatPinaud and MelloPage 12J Chem Neuroanat. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscript', 'compose the auditory system may correspond to some extent to the neuronal populations ofdifferent layers of the mammalian auditory cortex (Mello et al., 1998; Vates et al., 1996; Wildet al., 1993). For instance, subfield L2a might be analogous to the auditory cortical layer 4,given that it is the main recipient of direct thalamic auditory projections. L2a targets includingNCM and CMM appear to be analogous to supragranular layers of auditory cortical areas andarcopallial cells (i.e., cells in the cup region) that originate long descending projections toauditory nuclei would be analogous to infragranular layers. Thus, the caudomedial lobe thatencompasses medial field L2a, NCM and CMM may contain an over-representation of cellpopulations (e.g. GABAergic cells) seen in granular and supragranular layers of themammalian auditory cortex, should such a correspondence prove correct.Only vocal learning birds possess telencephalic vocal control nuclei. While the reason may beprimarily that vocal learning requires vocal motor representations within telencephalic circuits(see below), it is also possible that vocal control circuits in song learners need to have directaccess to information processed in telencephalic auditory areas. Our current data attest to theprominence of GABAergic elements in the latter areas in zebra finches. In addition, experience-dependent plasticity has been described in auditory telencephalic areas, namely song-specifichabituation in NCM and experience-dependent changes in unit selectivity in CMM (Chew etal., 1995; Gentner and Margoliash, 2003). Although not directly tested, GABAergicmechanisms could be involved in regulating plasticity and other basic aspects of the physiologyof these areas. In fact, patch-clamp recordings of NCM slices have given indication that NCMis under the influence of a powerful inhibitory network at rest, whose action may prevent NCMfrom runaway excitation upon its activation (Pinaud et al., 2004). Further studies are requiredto test whether GABAergic influence at this level of the brain can affect perceptual aspects ofvocal learning such as the acquisition of song auditory memories or the feedback evaluationof song.GABAergic Elements in the Song Control SystemThe relatively high densities of GABAergic neurons we observed in all song control nucleisuggest that inhibitory transmission is key to the physiology of the song control system. Ingeneral, these observations are consistent with the high incidence of GABAergic cells inmammalian pallial and striatal areas, where they provide the major inhibitory component oflocal processing networks (Gerfen, 1988; Smith and Bolam, 1990; Smith et al., 1987). As inauditory areas, the marked variability we saw in GABAergic soma size in all song nucleisuggests the possible existence of distinct subpopulations of inhibitory cells.The high density of GABAergic cells in the zebra finch homologue of the basal ganglia,including song nucleus area X, is consistent with the prevalence of GABAergic neurons in thebasal ganglia in mammals. Interestingly, area X has mixed striatal and pallidal features, thelatter consisting of GABAergic cells that project to thalamic nucleus DLM (Luo and Perkel,1999a; Luo and Perkel, 1999b). It seems reasonable to suggest that the large GABAergic cellsin area X, which were relatively few and sparse, could correspond to the inhibitory neuronsthat participate in the area X to DLM projection. Both area X and DLM are components of thesong system’s anterior forebrain pathway, which is implicated in song learning but not in themotor control of song production (Bottjer et al., 1984; Scharff and Nottebohm, 1991; Sohrabjiet al., 1990). This pathway is equivalent to mammalian basal ganglia-thalamocortical loopsthat are involved, among other things, in the learning and performance of movement sequencesthat require complex sensory-motor integration (Jarvis and Nottebohm, 1997; Jarvis et al.,1998; Simpson and Vicario, 1990; Bottjer et al., 1989; Luo and Perkel, 1999b). We alsoobserved that area X contains a high density of small GABAergic cells. They presumablycorrespond to GAD-positive cells that do not participate in the X-to-DLM projection (Luo andPerkel, 1999b) and that are thought to be part of local processing networks within area X.Pinaud and MelloPage 13J Chem Neuroanat. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 November 17.NIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author ManuscriptNIH-PA Author Manuscript', 'The pallial song control nuclei (LMAN, HVC and RA) also contain several small GABAergicneurons that are most likely local inhibitory cells. Our measurements, however, give indicationthat GABAergic cell size is predominantly large in all pallial song nuclei. To some extent, thismay reflect the generally larger neuronal size in these nuclei as compared with adjacent areas.It is possible, however, that long-range inhibitory projections might not be specific to theanterior forebrain pathway and that at least some of the large GABAergic cells in pallial songnuclei might represent projection neurons. In RA, for instance, some neurons that project tonXIIts are immunopositive for the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) (Wild et al.,2001). Because PV-positive cells are thought to represent a subpopulation of GABAergicneurons (Reynolds et al., 2004; Reynolds et al., 2001), it is possible that the RA-to-nXIItsprojection might be partly GABAergic and thus exert a partly inhibitory effect on thismedullary RA target (Wild et al., 2001). This intriguing possibility remains to be determinedexperimentally. In contrast, recent evidence indicates that the HVC neurons that project toeither area X or to RA do not co-express parvalbumin, calbindin or calretinin (Wild et al.,2005). Rather, these calcium-binding proteins appear to define populations of HVCinterneurons. Because the three proteins co-localize highly with GABA and together arethought to comprise most or all GABAergic neurons (DeFelipe, 1997), we conclude that theGABAergic cells in HVC are very likely interneurons and not projection neurons.GABAergic transmission in RA plays a significant role in the generation of appropriate songstructure, and has been proposed to regulate the initiation and control of vocal output (Vicarioand Raksin, 2000). In addition, the synchronous output from RA projection neurons is thoughtto be controlled by the activation of local GABAergic interneurons (Spiro et al., 1999).Interestingly, PV-positive cells in the rodent hippocampus have been reported to reliablydisplay fast-firing behavior, while GABAergic cells that express other calcium-bindingproteins, namely calbindin and calretinin, do not exhibit consistent firing behavior (Kawaguchiet al., 1987). These observations are of potential relevance to RA physiology, where the fastneuronal firing required to reliably generate song structure could be related to the prominentlocal GABAergic network described here and to the high density of PV-positive cells (Wildet al., 2001). Similar roles for GABAergic transmission, mediated through GABA-A receptors,have been shown for song nucleus LMAN, where firing behavior is controlled by inhibitoryinterneurons (Bottjer et al., 1998). Altogether, our current data and the physiological studiesdiscussed above indicate that GABAergic elements are present and prevalent in song controlnuclei, and that inhibition plays a significant role in the normal physiology of the song system.In sum, our data have provided a detailed characterization of GABAergic elements throughoutthe ascending auditory pathway and song control nuclei of the zebra finch brain. These findingsshould help in the interpretation of previous anatomical and physiological studies in zebrafinches, as well as stimulate future investigations on the properties of inhibitory networkswithin the songbird brain.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Drs.
